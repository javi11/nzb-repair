# nzb-repair

A tool to repair incomplete NZB files by reuploading the missing articles using the par2 repair.

## Usage

1. Create a config file `config.yaml` with your Usenet provider details:

```yaml
download_providers:
  - host: news.example.com
    port: 563
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
    connections: 10
    tls: true
upload_providers:
  - host: upload.example.com
    port: 563
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
    connections: 5
    tls: true
```

2. Run the tool:

**Single File Repair:**

```sh
nzbrepair -c config.yaml path/to/your.nzb
```

**Watch Mode (Monitor a directory):**

```sh
nzbrepair watch -c config.yaml -d /path/to/watch/directory
```

**Options:**

_Flags applicable to both modes:_

- `-c, --config`: Config file path (required)
- `-o, --output`: Output file path or directory for repaired nzb files (optional, defaults vary by mode: next to input file for single repair, `repaired/` subdirectory for watch mode)
- `--tmp-dir`: Temporary directory for processing files (optional, defaults to system temp dir)
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging (optional)

_Flags specific to Watch Mode:_

- `-d, --dir`: Directory to watch for nzb files (required for watch mode)
